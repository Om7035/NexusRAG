## Overview

NexusRAG combines high-fidelity document parsing with a fully modular architecture, enabling developers to create powerful, data-aware applications. Our framework is designed with several core pillars:

1. **Action (Agents)**: Build autonomous AI agents that can reason and act on complex data
2. **Data Depth (Parsing)**: Extract rich information from multimodal documents with high fidelity
3. **Modularity (Architecture)**: Pluggable components that can be easily swapped and extended
4. **Advanced Features**: Document chunking, metadata filtering, and multimodal processing

## Features

- **Multimodal Parsing**: High-fidelity extraction from PDFs, Word documents, HTML, Markdown, and other formats
- **Modular Design**: Pluggable components for parsers, embedders, vector stores, and LLMs
- **Agent-Ready**: Built for creating autonomous AI agents that can reason over complex data
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new components and customize existing ones
- **Multiple Providers**: Support for OpenAI, Cohere, Pinecone, Weaviate, Anthropic, and more
- **Advanced Features**: Document chunking, metadata filtering, and multimodal processing
